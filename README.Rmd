The goal of ordered is to enable additional classification models for ordinal outcomes (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"). While there are several model/engine combinations in the parsnip package that can be used, this package adds:

 - ordinal forests [Hornung R. (2020)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C7&q=10.1007%2Fs00357-018-9302-x&btnG=)

More will be added. 

There are some existing features in tidymodels packages that are useful for ordinal outcomes: 

 - The "partykit" engines for [parsnip::decision_tree()] and [parsnip:: rand_forest()] use the ordered nature of the factors to train the model. 
 - The yardstick package has [yardstick::kap()] for weighted and unweighted Kappa statistics (the former being of more interest). Also, [yardstick::classification_cost()] can utilize more complex cost structures and uses the class probabilities for estimation. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ordered like so:

``` r
pak::pak("topepo/ordered")
```

## Example

Here is a simple example using computational chemistry data to predict the permeability of a molecule: 

```{r}
library(ordered)
library(dplyr)

data(caco, package = "QSARdata")

caco_dat <-
  inner_join(caco_Outcome, caco_Dragon, by = "Molecule") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(class = Class, mol_weight = QikProp_mol_MW,
         volume = QikProp_volume, ClogP)
  caco_train <- caco_dat[-(1:5), ]
  caco_test  <- caco_dat[ (1:5), ]

ord_rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest(mtry = 2, trees = 100) %>% # you should really use many more trees
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("ordinalForest")

set.seed(382)
ord_rf_fit <- ord_rf_spec %>% fit(class ~ ., data = caco_train)
augment(ord_rf_fit, caco_test)
```
