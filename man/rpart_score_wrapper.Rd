\title{A wrapper for \code{rpartScore}}
\usage{
rpart_score_wrapper(formula, data, split_func = "abs", prune_func = "mc", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The formula to pass.}

\item{data}{The data frame to pass.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass.}
}
\description{
A wrapper is used for two reasons: First, the model interface requires the
response variable to be numeric rather than ordered or factor; the wrapper
edits the input \code{data} accordingly. Second, the engine argument \code{split} is
unclear and possibly overloaded; the wrapper instead uses the more suggestive
\code{split_func} and, for consistency, handles the other engine argument
analogously.
